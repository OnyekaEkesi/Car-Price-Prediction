## Project Overview

Car Price Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict car prices based on features such as make, model year, mileage, condition, fuel type, and transmission type. It provides insights into the key factors influencing car prices.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project locally for development and testing.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python:** The project is written in Python, so Python installation is essential. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or use package managers like Anaconda or Miniconda.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) to isolate dependencies.
4. Activate the virtual environment and install the project dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Visualization

Visualize data insights such as feature importance and distribution. Example visualizations include:

- A scatter plot showing car prices against mileage.
- A bar chart displaying average prices by car make.

## Results and Potential Enhancements

This project uses a machine learning model to predict car prices based on input features. While the current implementation provides reliable predictions, there is room for improvement:

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the model for better accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering:** Add additional relevant features such as location or seller type.
- **Model Exploration:** Experiment with advanced models like neural networks.

## Deployment

The model can be deployed as a web application using Streamlit, making it accessible to users for real-time predictions. Further deployment to cloud platforms like AWS or Azure ensures scalability.

## Benefits

- **Better Decision-Making:** Enables buyers and sellers to make informed decisions based on accurate price predictions.
- **Market Insights:** Helps car dealerships understand market trends and pricing strategies.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces the time and effort involved in manual price estimations.
